\section{Introduction}
This project is about the development of the back-end of the bootstrap compiler for the Meta-Casanova 3 language.
The back-end is responsible for generating an executable after receiving the type-checked information from the front-end.

Compilers are complex programs that have to operate on a wide range of inputs.
Since compilers have such a large input-space, the chance of a bug hiding somewhere is substantial. 
But for al their complexity, compilers also have to be bug-free since every program can only be as bug-free as its compiler.

Abstractions can help in this regard.
The limits of which were observed when implementing the compiler for the Casanova language in F\#.
The compiler was 0000 lines long, and became unmaintainable.
After a rewrite in MC it was 000 lines\cite{maggiore}.

The primary reason for this was the lack of higher-order type operators.
This made abstractions such as monad-transformers impossible, hampering modularity and resulted in a lot of boilerplate code.

In this document, we will walk through the backend and examine the various parts and their design decisions.
In this way, this document aims to be useful to the future developers of the MC compiler.
