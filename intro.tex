\section{Intro}
Writing compilers is a difficult task.

Compilers are complex programs that have to operate on a wide range of inputs.
Since compilers have such a large input-space, the chance of a bug hiding somewhere is substantial. 
But compilers also have to be bug-free, since every program can only be as bug-free as its compiler.

Abstractions can help in this regard.
The limits of which were observed when implementing the compiler for the Casanova language in F\#.

The functional aproach to parsers are parser monads.
But since F\# has no higher-order type operators, it is not possible to write monad-transformers.
This hampers modularity and resulted in a lot of boilerplate code.

The Casanova compiler written in F\# was 0000 lines long, and became unmaintainable.
After a rewrite in MC it was 000 lines[Maggiore].

This project is about the back-end of the bootstrap compiler voor Meta-Casanova 3, written in F\#.
The back-end is responsible for generating an executable after receiving the type-checked information from the front-end.

In this document, we will walk through the backend and examine the various parts and their design decisions.
In this way, this document aims to be useful to the future developers of the MC compiler.
