\section{Introduction}
This project is about the development of the back-end of the bootstrap compiler for the Meta-Casanova 3 language.
The back-end is responsible for generating an executable after receiving the type-checked information from the front-end.

Compilers are complex programs that have to operate on a wide range of inputs.
Since compilers have such a large input-space, the chance of a bug hiding somewhere is substantial. 
But for al their complexity, compilers also have to be bug-free since every program can only be as bug-free as its compiler.

Abstractions can help in this regard.
The limits of which were observed when implementing the compiler for the Casanova language in F\#.
The compiler was 0000 lines long, and became unmaintainable.
After a rewrite in MC it was 000 lines\cite{maggiore}.

The primary reason for this was the lack of higher-order type operators.
This made abstractions such as monad-transformers impossible, hampering modularity and resulted in a lot of boilerplate code.

In this thesis, we will walk through the backend and examine the various parts and their design decisions.
In this way, this document aims to be useful to the future developers of the MC compiler.

We will first discuss the context of the assignment.
Then we will give a short overview of Meta Casanova.

Research, The main part of is thesis, is next.
It presents the main research question and splits it in subquestions.
Each subquestion is answered in each subsection.

The Results presents the proof that the requirements of the main research question have been met.
This is followed by the conclusions that summarize the results.
After the thesis proper, We give recommendations for the future development of the backend.
The reflection is the last part of the thesis, and shows that the dublin descriptors have been met.

The apendices contain the contact details of the stakeholders, a glossary and the full source code of the backend.

%These subquestions will be answered in their respective subsections in section \ref{research}.
