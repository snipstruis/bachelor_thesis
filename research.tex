\section{Research}\label{research}

The primary research question of this thesis is:

\input{question}

The first requirement exists because the compiler must be reliable.
Any program can at most be as reliable as the compiler used to generate it.

\label{whydotnet}
The second requirement existed because of the need for a large library and inter-operability with Unity game engine.
This is because the main area of research of the organization is game-related\footnote{see section~\ref{motive}}.

The third requirement is because the games must be cross platform.

The performance requirement is there because games have to be performant.

In order to answer the research question, seven subquestions were formulated.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item In what language should the code generator produce its output?
    \item What should the interface be between the front-end and the back-end?
    \item What should the intermediate representation of the functions be?
    \item How does the interface map to the output language?
    \item How to generate names so that they comply with the output language?
    \item How to validate the code-generator?
    \item How to validate the test programs?
\end{enumerate}

%As discussed in section~\ref{research_questions}, the main research question is split in subquestions.
Each answer of a subquestion is proven by implementing a part of the backend. 

To illustrate how the different parts of the back-end relate to each other, here is a diagram of the dataflow through the backend.

As you can see, the front-end interface contains the Intermediate Representation (IR) and goes through the validator.
From there, depending on the compiler flags, it either goes to the interpreter or the codegen.
In case it goes to the interpreter, the program is directly executed.
In case it goes to the codegen, it is translated to the output language.
To translate all the identifiers, the mangler is needed.
The debugger is optionally embedded in the executable, depending on compiler flags.
