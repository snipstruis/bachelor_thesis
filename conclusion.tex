\section{Conclusions}\label{conclusions}
The result is a working, reliable, performant back-end, with interpreter, validator and embedded debugger.
All finished within the time frame of the internship.

To prove it works, three test programs were written.
All are correctly generated, all run in the interpreter, and all can be debugged.
