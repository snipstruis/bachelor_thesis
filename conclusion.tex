\section{Conclusions}\label{conclusions}
In this thesis, we have shown how typechecked metacasanova can be transformed into an executable program.
We did this by first finding that C\# was the output language of choice.
We then showed a simple interface with an orthogonal IR.
After that, we showed how to map the IR to C\# statements with correctly generated identifiers.
To validate the code generator, a simple interpreter was written, and finally we have shown how to embed a debugger in the executable.

When the back-end was finished, we checked our requirements to see if they have been met.
We showed that the back-end generates correct code and inter-operates with .NET by using test programs that use every IR instruction, including the .NET instructions.
We also showed that the back-end runs on multiple platforms, and that the performance of MC is greater that that of Python with benchmarks.

The result is a working, reliable, performant back-end, with interpreter, validator and embedded debugger.
All finished within the time frame of the internship.

This program, along with the documentation, will help the research group with their implementation of Casanova and the evolution of Meta Casanova.
These technologies can then be applied in the virtual reality and video game development.
