\section{Evaluation}\label{evaluation}
In this section I will show that I have the competentions associated with computer science according to Rotterdam University of applied sciences.

\subsubsection{Administering}


\subsubsection{Analyzing}

\subsubsection{Advizing}


\subsubsection{Designing}
The parts of the back end are modular and communicate with eachother through well-defined interfaces.
This made it easy to respond to changes in the language, as changes in one part have no effect on the other parts.

\subsubsection{Realizing}
I managed to to realize a working compiler within the allocated time.
