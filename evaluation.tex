\section{Evaluation}\label{evaluation}
In this section I will show that I have the competences associated with computer science according to Rotterdam University of applied sciences.

\subsubsection{Administering} 
I initiated the move away from SVN to Git, to make us more productive.

\subsubsection{Analyzing}
I have split the back-end problem up in managable chunks.

\subsubsection{Advising}
This thesis also serves as a documentation of the back-end.

\subsubsection{Designing}
The parts of the back-end are modular and communicate with each other through well-defined interfaces.
This made it easy to respond to changes in the language, as changes in one part have no effect on the other parts.

\subsubsection{Realizing}
I managed to to realize a working compiler back-end within the allocated time.
