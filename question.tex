\textit{How to implement a transformation from typechecked Meta-Casanova(MC) in executable code?}

Where the transformation must satisfy these requirements:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The backend must in no case produce an incorrect program.
    \item The executable must be able to inter-operate with .NET.
    \item The generated code must run on all the platforms .NET runs on.
    \item The performance of the generated program should be comparable to Python.
\end{enumerate}
