\textit{How to implement a transformation from typechecked Meta Casanova (MC) from the front-end, to executable code within the timeframe of the internship?}

Where the transformation must satisfy these requirements:
\begin{description}
    \item[The correctness requirement:] The back-end must in no case produce an incorrect program.
    \item[The .NET requirement:] The executable must be able to inter-operate with .NET.
    \item[The multiplatform requirement:] The generated code must run on all the platforms .NET runs on.
    \item[The performance requirement:] The performance of the generated program should be better than Python.
\end{description}
